What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates a folder that stores all of the meta data. This is needed to be able to start tracking all of your files

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area shows the changed files that are going to be committed in the next commit. This is different than the working directory, which shows all files regardless of whether or not they are committed or not, and the repository which only has committed files. The staging area gives you control over what files you want to bundle into a single commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

It allows you to select the files you want to include in a commit and using git diff and git diff --staged, you can view the logical changes as it moves from the working directory to the repository.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

Branches would be helpful when creating new experimental features in a program or making other divergent changes that could break otherwise well-behaving code. Branching allows you to make these changes without altering the original code and then combine the changes when needed.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

Diagrams allow you to see the how all of the branches are connected. Furthermore they help you understand how each commit is related (i.e. whose parent commit is whose) and helps you to understand the reachability of each branch.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

The result is a commit with two parents.

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?

Prevents git from guessing which code is right. stops unwanted bugs
