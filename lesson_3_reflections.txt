When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

You would want to do this when you are collaborating with others or you are working on multiple computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Sometimes commits don't represent a completed feature. Automatically, pushing and pulling would make these features public when you may not want them to be public.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

Forks copy repositories that are on the GitHub server. Clones copy repositories from GitHub servers to local directories (and copy repositories on local directories to local directories), branches make changes to the a single repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

It allows you to make offline changes to the remote branch, thus reducing the any merge conflict you may have with between your local and remote file copies.
